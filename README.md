# Bifurcation in a Planar Oscillator System

This repository contains the notebook `bifurcation.ipynb`, where I study a
two–dimensional dynamical system that undergoes a global bifurcation of limit
cycles. The three figures generated by the notebook are saved as

- `3.png` – trajectories for the first parameter set  
- `4.png` – trajectories for the second parameter set  
- `transition.png` – trajectories for a slow parameter change between the two

## The system

We consider a point 
```math
(x(t), y(t))
````
moving in the plane according to

```math
\dot{x} =
\sum_{k=1}^{4}
\frac{(x-a_k)\big[1-(x-a_k)^2-(y-b_k)^2\big] - (y-b_k)}
     {1 + (x-a_k)^6 + (y-b_k)^6},
````

```math
\dot{y} =
\sum_{k=1}^{4}
\frac{(y-b_k)\big[1-(x-a_k)^2-(y-b_k)^2\big] + (x-a_k)}
     {1 + (x-a_k)^6 + (y-b_k)^6}.
```

Each pair 
```math
(a_k,b_k)
````
is a “center” in the plane. Around a single center, the
vector field behaves like a Hopf oscillator:

* trajectories spiral away from the center,
* then approach a circular **stable limit cycle** of radius roughly (1),
* the motion along the cycle is a steady rotation.

The denominator
```math
1 + (x-a_k)^6 + (y-b_k)^6
````
localizes each oscillator: its influence decays quickly away from its center. The full vector field is the sum of four such localized oscillators.

## Numerical method

All trajectories in the notebook are computed with an explicit 4th–order
Runge–Kutta (RK4) method:

- time step: `dt = 0.1`
- state vector:
  ```math
  z = (x, y)
  ````
- integrator: standard RK4 with fixed time step

Initial conditions are taken on the boundary of the square
```math
[0,8] \times [0,8]:
````

- I generate 5 equally spaced points on each side (including corners),
- remove duplicated corners,
- and integrate forward in time from each of these boundary points.

This gives a nice picture of the basins of attraction and the long–time
behaviour of the system.

## Case 3 – four separate limit cycles (`3.png`)

In the first experiment I fix

```math
a = [2, 2, 6, 6], \qquad
b = [2, 6, 2, 6].
````

This places four centers near the corners of an inner square.  
The notebook:

1. defines the vector field with these parameters,
2. integrates all boundary initial conditions forward in time,
3. plots the trajectories in the \((x,y)\)-plane.

Result (shown in `3.png`):

- Around each
  ```math
  (a_k, b_k)
  ````
   there is an almost circular **stable limit cycle**.
- Trajectories starting on the outer square are attracted to one of four
  distinct cycles.
- The phase plane is therefore split into **four basins of attraction**.

## Case 4 – one global “clover’’ limit cycle (`4.png`)

Next I move the centers closer together:

```math
a = [2, 2, 4, 4], \qquad
b = [2, 4, 2, 4].
````

Running the same RK4 integration and plotting procedure gives the figure
`4.png`.  The behaviour changes qualitatively:

- the four separate circular limit cycles disappear,
- they are replaced by a **single larger, clover–shaped stable limit cycle**
  surrounding all four centers,
- every trajectory from the boundary now converges to this **one** periodic
  orbit.

So the number of attractors changes from 4 to 1 and the attracting set changes
from four disjoint circles to a single connected closed curve.

## Slowly varying parameters and the transition (`transition.png`)

To visualise the actual **transition** between the two regimes, the notebook
introduces time–dependent parameters.

The result is saved as `transition.png`.  It shows how trajectories initially
behave as in case 3, then deform as the centers move, and eventually settle
near the clover–shaped attractor of case 4.

## Bifurcation description

Overall, the system exhibits a **global bifurcation of limit cycles** as the
parameters are varied:

- For the first parameter set there are **four stable limit cycles**, each
  localized around one center.
- For the second parameter set there is **one global stable limit cycle**
  enclosing all centers.
- When the parameters are slowly changed in time from the first to the second
  configuration, the system transitions from four separate attractors to a
  single global attractor.

This merging of several stable limit cycles into one global limit cycle is the
bifurcation studied in `bifurcation.ipynb`.
